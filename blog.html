				<h4 style="bold"> Hi! My name's Evan and this is a blog page I made, my first to be exact, haha. This whole blog thing is kind of new to me, but my dad insisted I try it out. Anyways, since I'll probably be the only one to ever post on here anyways, it probably won't be all that interesting and I don't even know if I'll ever use this...well, I guess whatever happens, happens! </h4>

				<br> 
				<p> I don't really know how to start this, didn't really think to far into it...anyways, I'm going on a trip to Europe with my family for my birthday (though it was just last week). My parents were suuuper insistent on having us go, and I mean, I still think it's cool and all, but it kinda just seems like they're using my birthday as an excuse to go an see Europe. Well, I guess I'll just make another update when I get the airport if I'm bored. Ciao~ </p>

				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> Alright, I arrived at the airport about a half hour ago, and I'm already bored to death. My mom is reading some weird book and my dad has already fallen asleep, well, he did drive all the way here so I geus I'll him a break. Anyways, I don't really know what to type about and I'm really only doing this to satisfy my boredom. Oh, I know, I'll write about some of the weird people around the terminal. Let's see, over by one of the shops there's an old lady buying waaay too many sweet teas. I don't even know what she's gonna do with those, because there's no way a human being can even drink that many. There's lots of business people wearing suits and talking on phones, that's not very interesting. Well, I guess I'll make another post if I see anything interesting happen. Ciao!~ </p>

				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> Oh, some weird old guy just started yelling at some employee about how his flight just got delayed. He's in a wheelchair and he's wearing an 'Army' hat. I feel bad for the guy, but I think security is about to escort him away somewhere, he seemed really angry. Oh, mom just said that our flight is leaving soon, so I have to back my laptop away. I'll make another entry when we land, I don't know when we're landing, but I think that we're going to London first. Maybe I'll get to see Big Ben? I'll write about it when I get there. Ciao~ </p>

				<h2 id="entry2"> Accident // 12-11-02 </h2>
				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> Oh god. oh god oh god oh god. I...I dont know what to do. There, there was a man...and he had a bomb strapped to his chest under his jacket and was holding a gun. He was going on about how he was gonna kill everyone if they didn't do as he said, I think he wanted to crash us into a building before we land. God what time was it, I can't even remember, I think we had almost landed when he did it, and then one of the pilot tried fighting him for the gun but he shot him. He <em>-redacted-</em> shot him in the chest and killed him. I..I think he got tacked by the other pilot and some passengers, but the bomb. The bomb went off and...they must all be dead. I don't think anyone else is alive, but I don't where I am, and I don't know what to do. Everything is cold and I don't think I'm injured badly but my arm is bleeding. Can I get pneumonia from all of the snow? Am I going to die, just like everyone else? I've already gathered anything that looks useful from whatever was left, but I stopped after a while because of the...bodies. I didn't want to find Mom and Dad. Jesus, why did we even decided to go on this trip? None of this would have happened if I'd just wanted a normal party...I think I'm going to continue writing my thought to keep track of time and to occupy myself, but I won't have infinite battery. I don't even know if any of this is going to be public, no, I dont care. If someone, anyone finds this...I don't want to be forgotten. I'm going to go find someplace to start a fire, clear my thoughts a little. I saw in a movie once that most people die from the weather than they do animals. Ciao.. </p>

				<h2 id="entry2"> Shelter // 12-12-02 </h2>
				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> I found a cave not too far from the crash and was able to start a fire with a lighter and some stuff I found laying around the plane, I almost feel like taking all those years of Boy Scouts was a waste, hah. I haven't really thought much of what to do to pass time, so I just tried to make the cave as livable as possible. Anyways, I didn't want to go too far, just in case someone comes and finds it. They're gonna find it, right? No, of course they will, there's no way flights just disappear, at least I'll know that they'll show up...eventually. Anyways, I'm gonna get some sleep, if I even can. I'll write next time something happens or i have nothing to do, don't wanna waste battery. Ciao </p>

				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> I've not really been up to much these past few days. Hah, yknow, I figured by now that help would have showed up, but I don't wanna push my luck. Actually, screw that, it's not like I've had any good luck up until now anyways. I mean, my life hasn't been anything special, I haven't made any friends, and I don't even have anything I enjoy doing. Maybe this is what I deserve for being worthless..No, this isn't good, I need to stay positive. I'll get out of here eventually, I just need a plan, yeah, a plan will work. I'm gonna go make a plan, and get out of this <em>-redacted-</em> hole. ill write again when I've got one. Ciao  </p>

				<h2 id="entry2"> The Plan // 12-19...20?-02 </h2>
				<br> 
				<p id="alignCenter"> Alright! I've finally got a plan! These past few days, I think at least I kinda lost track of time when I was exploring and had to stay out and almo-. Wait, I'm getting off track. Anyways, i have this <em>genius</em> plan on getting back to civilization! I went around and scavenged the best stuff possible from around the plane and and made a sled to carry it all around. I tried staying away from where I woke up the first day, but honestly, everything is frozen over so I don't think I'd even be able to tell what bodies are Mom or Dad's...Anyways, I did some searching and found this mountain that looked close enough to me, and I think I'll even be able to get to the top! Considering we shouldn't have been too far from London when the guy with the vest blue up, I should be able to see where the nearest city is and then get there and tell everyone what happened! It's not perfect, I know, but I'ts all I've got, and...and it's gotta work! Crap, I only have about 25% battery left. I gotta go for now, but I'm gonna make another entry as soon as I get to that mountain/hill. </p>

				<p id="alignCenter"> Man, I messed up, I really screwed up this time, haha. After getting all of my stuff together, I set out for that mountain after i woke up. it was about halfway up there when the sled got stuck on a dead log and I tripped. I think I sprained my ankle, it's hard to walk. I'm gonna try to get up again in a minute, god it's so cold. </p>

				<p id="alignCenter"> I made it to the top. I think I would have just been better pretending that everything was ok, and just stayed down in that <em>-redacted-</em> cave. There's no hope for me, I'm to die here. There's nothing but snow for miled and miles in every direction. Who was I even kidding? There wasn't going to be any civilization out here, I'm probably no where even near <em>-redacted-</em> London. I'd go back down to the cave but I can't with this leg, i dont have food left, and it's already dark, all I have is the light from my lighter and this laptop. I think..I think I'm going to try and sleep here for a while, it's so cold i can barely even type this sentence </p>
