				<h2 id="ramen"> Instant Ramen </h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 25 pix; margin-right: 25px"> Instant ramen has almost cemented it's place in society as the best go to meal for those just scraping to get by. It's quick, it's easy, it tastes decent, and most importantly, you can get it for super cheap. Like, just go any convenience store and you can find a bunch of them for literally a single quarter. You could eat three square meals a day for an entire year for just $142.65! Ramen is also just one of those dishes that you can almost entirely customize, this way, every meal can have variety!. Worry not, even if your mouth quivers at the thought of having one more bowl of instant noodles, at the end of the day, you'll find yourself satisfied with your meal and walk away knowing you just saved some of your hard earned cash. </p>

						<li> Open your instant ramen packet, or cup </li>
						<br>
						<li> Fill a pot with water (the water will become you're broth, and can be adjusted to your liking) and boil </li>
						<br>
						<li> Once boiled, place your ramen into the water and stir occasionally until the noodles have broken apart </li>
						<br>
						<li> Once the noodles have softened, insert the flavoring packet and any other vegetables/toppings/seasonings you like (I personally recommend adding an egg and several spoons of soy sauce)
						<br>
						<li> Pour into a bowl and enjoy! </li>
						<br>
						<p> Alternatively, you can simply microwave it as well, though, the quality will significantly change. Simply put the ramen and water into a microwavable bowl and microwave for about 3-5 minutes. Add any extra vegetables/toppings/seasonings after letting the ramen cool and enjoy! (Note: It's advised to <strong>NOT</strong> microwave any kind of cup noodles in foam cups, as the foam can melt from the heat and become harmful) </p>

				<h2 id="bread"> Just Bread </h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 25 pix; margin-right: 25px"> Sometimes, you just need something simple. Something so simple that you literally don't have to prep anything. That, my friend, is exactly what bread is. You might be wondering, "what's so special about bread anyways?" and to that, I am sincerely appalled at your ignorance. Bread is here in this fine selection of <em>poor people</em> gourmet foods not because of it being especially cheap or especially good even. It's here because of it's <strong>versatility</strong>! To elaborate, bread is simply good to be eaten with anything. It can have butter, jelly, cinnamon-suger, honey, hotdogs, egg salad, anything! Bread provides what the body needs in nutrients, and whatever else you want on can provide in flavor, making for a truly unique meal. </p>
