		<h1> My First Website </h1>
		<br>
		<p><str>Welcome, to my very first website where, by requirement, I'll say a little about myself and my spirit animal.</str></p>
		<p> My name's Kade and I'm 16, a sophomore in highschool. Including myself, I have a family of five, and a lot of animals.</p>
		<p> (Five cats and two dogs to be exact, though I used to have a lot more) My hobbies include, but aren't limited to, video games, reading manga, </p> 
		<p> skateboarding, and just listening to music. If I had any spirit animal, It'd probably be Doge. </p>
		<br>
		<img src="Images/doge.jpg" width=25%>
		<br>
		<p> The instructions concerning the spirit animal paragraph were vague so I'm taking this opportunity to add my own sense of humor. </p>
		<p> I don't really even have anything in common with Doge, but I personally believe spirit animals are kinda dumb, so I took my own test aand yeah. </p>
		<p> My spirit animal is by far the best spirit animal because he just looks dope and he's super funny, I mean, just look at his face. </p>
		<p> Also, did you know that Doge is an actual dog? He's from a breed of dog called Shiba Inu, which were used in Japan as hunting dogs, though, </p>
		<p> now	Shiba Inu's are just expensive because they're just too cool to simply hunt anymore. Anyways, that's my spirit animal, and he's better than yours. </p>
